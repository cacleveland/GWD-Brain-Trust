# GWD-Brain-Trust
Repository for developing GW questions and research 
9/28/2018: 
Present focus on developing analyses aimed at investigating the genetic diversity of GW on a micro-scale (i.e. village), and seeking to identify which villages are "endemic" or acting as sources of infection for other villages. The use of distance models, networks, and human/resource movement have been discussed. 
Current goals as of date of writing: (1) Compile questions and ideas as "brainstorming" session to begin parsing out what our strongest questions are; (2) Decide on appropriate methods to answer/inform questions; (3) discuss potential outcomes and deliverables/interventions; (4) create proposal for The Carter Center approval.
